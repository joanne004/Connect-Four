# Connect Four

Welcome to the Connect Four Game, a classic two-player connection game implemented in Java. Test your strategic skills as you compete against a friend to connect four discs of your color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

* Classic Connect Four gameplay with a user-friendly Java Swing interface.
* Two-player mode for head-to-head competition.
* Dynamic turn indicators for Red and Blue players.
* Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections.
* Game outcome messages and button disabling for a clear winner.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `ConnectFour.java` file.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns placing discs.
3. Connect four discs of your color to win the game.

## What I Learned
In the process of developing this Connect Four game, I gained valuable experience in:

* Implementing Java Swing for GUI.
* Event Handling: Capturing and responding to user input events.
* Managing user input and game events.
* Designing and implementing game logic.

## Future Improvements
I plan to enhance this project further by:

* Implementing a single-player mode against an AI opponent.
* Adding difficulty levels for the AI.
* Scoreboard: Implement a scoreboard to keep track of players' wins and display the overall standings.
